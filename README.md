## Project Overview

This project replicates the basic look and feel of Amazon's website UI. It includes key UI components such as:

- Responsive **Header** with logo, search bar, and navigation options  
- Functional **Dropdown menus**  
- Product **Cards** showcasing items  
- Clean **Footer** with relevant links  
- Usage of **CSS positioning** (`absolute`, `relative`, etc.) to achieve layout accuracy and UI polish

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS layout techniques and practice building real-world inspired UI components.
